I attempted to make my ai a bit smarter than just picking a random legal move.
I did not study any Othello strategy so this ai is not extremely smart, but I did
try to have it make the most optimal move each time.

I did this by having a function that looks at each space on the board, decides
if it is a legal move or not using my legal_move function, and then store the space
coordinates in a dictionary as the key with the value being the number of tiles
that would be flipped to white if that move is made.

Then I "sorted the dictionary" by value so the largest value aka largest number of tiles
to be flipped to white would be the first key value tuple in the sorted list. I then grab
this tuple and say that it is the best move. 

This is the tile the ai chooses to place each turn. It does work as I expected and has made playing
the game as the player very challenging!

The computer beats me and my friends most of the time. I've only won
once by chance because I don't want to take the time to calculate my best move!

I would love to improve on the intelligence of my ai, but I am not that familiar with the game
Othello until now, so I would have to do more research.

It works as well as I wanted it to.
