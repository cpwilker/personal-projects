Tests for Othello Part 1:

Here are the classes and methods for classes that I tested during 
part 1 of this assignment:

Tile:
    test_contructor: made sure color, column, and row were initialized successfully
    test_fill_color: tested property to make sure it returns the correct
    string based on the color attribute of Tile.

Tiles:
    test_contructor: made sure color and n were initialized correctly and that
        column_tiles and all_tiles were empty lists.
    test_get_all_tiles: made sure the lists were filled with proper nxn amount
        of tiles. column_tiles has length n and all_tiles has length n. Also made 
        sure a specific tile object can be accessed by column, row indicies
    test_change_color: made sure a tile object in a list of tile object would
        be replaced with a new tile object of a different color.
    test_starting_four_tiles: checked that after running this method, the tile
        objects at their middle 4 column, row indicies had the correct colors.
    

Board:
    test_contructor: made sure each parameter was being initialized correctly.
    test_count_colors: checked that after calling starting_four_tiles, the 
        number of white and black tiles were each equal to 2
    test_update: made sure that for a 4x4 board, after calling starting_four_tiles,
        the total_tiles != board_full. Tested that at this point, the winning_number == 0
        and the white_wins, black_wins, and tie are all still False.

GameController:
    test_contructor: check that the parameters are initialized correctly and
        that all starting winner bools are False. Also that winning_number == 0.
    test_update_terminal: Checked that nothing was printed to the terminal unless
        a winner bool was changed to True. Also that winning_number would be printed
        to terminal.

Because of all these tests, I am fully confident that part 1 of my Othello game works
correctly and to it's fullest capability at its current state.
